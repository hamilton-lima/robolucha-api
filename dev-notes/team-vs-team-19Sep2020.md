# Team vs Team implementation plan 

# Notes from July2020
## API
- Preload teamdefinition
- Add endpoint to join match with teaminformation

## Runner
- verify min number of team participants to start match 
- verify max number of team participants to join match 

## Game 
- add route to /lobby/:availableMatchID

Logic
- try to check status (what status?)
- start match if not started 
- if has team information and more than one ask to choose team
- then show button that redirects to /watch 

# Lets go!
